                <h2>What do each of the tags mean?</h2>
                <h3>IMCA - <a href="https://www.scie.org.uk/mca/imca/">Independent Mental Capacity Advocacy</a></h3>
                <p>Relating to the Mental Capacity Act (2005)</p>
                <h3>IMHA - Independent Mental Health Advocacy</h3>
                <p>For those under a section of the Mental Health Act (1983).<br>This sometimes includes informal patients who are not under section, but not always.</p>
                <h3>ICAA - Independent Care Act Advocacy</h3>
                <p>Relating to the Care Act (2014)<br> Sometimes simply referred to as care act advocacy.</p>
                <h3>IHCA - Independent Health Complaints Advocacy</h3>
                <p>Relating to the Health and Social Care Act (2012) <br>NHS health complaints, although some providers do social care health complaints
                    under the same or similar title.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Why do so few providers list Relevent Persons Representative (RPR) or DoLS IMCA services?</h2>
                <p>Whilst there is a statutory requirement, these referrals come through the DoLS teams within a given councils Social Care department. As they are usually the only source referrals are accepted from, it appears a lot of providers aren't displaying where they provide these services alongside the other 4 statutory services.</p>
                <h2>
                    What about the other tags?
                </h2>
                <p>These are included where the provider advertised other services on their websites alongside the 4 services which make the focus of this site, these are not complete to the services they may offer.</p>
                <h2>Can I use this data?</h2>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/beawitcht/advocacy-finder">Sure!</a> I'd appreciate the attribution but it's not necessary.</p>
